## More about the App

This is a Flutter based app, which can run on both Android and IOS and has been made adaptive and responsive to both the platforms.

Currently this app stores all the data locally on the device itself, not on any server. (One can consider this as a pre-release)

The current release only contains the .apk file as deployment of IOS app requires a Mac-OS based system (Not available to me currently).

## More about the App (Contd.)

There can be further scope of optimization which I have not yet explored. This can be considered as a pre-release of this app.

This is the first functional Flutter App I have created while learning flutter in the very first week. Hope you all like it.
