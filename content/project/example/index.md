The Personal Expenses app helps the user manage their expenses.

The user can add new transaction, user can select the date as well (can add a transaction in previous date as well).
The user can delete any previous transaction.
User can view the transactions of the last 7 days in the recent transactions chart available in the app.
This is a Flutter based app, which can run on both Android and IOS and has been made adaptive and responsive to both the platforms.

Currently this app stores all the data locally on the device itself, not on any server. (One can consider this as a pre-release)

The current release only contains the .apk file as deployment of IOS app requires a Mac-OS based system (Not available to me currently).

Direct Download Link of the app-release.apk: https://github.com/Kulpreet-Singh/personal_expenses_flutter/releases/download/1.0.0/app-release.apk
There can be further scope of optimization which I have not yet explored. This can be considered as a pre-release of this app.

This is the first functional Flutter App I have created while learning flutter in the very first week. Hope you all like it.
